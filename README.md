#MenuSights

##MenuSights is currently two things: 

1. A [webtool](http://www.menusights.com) developed during my time with Insight Health Data Science. It's based on a logistic regression classifier that analyzes names of items on local restaurant menus and provides a prediction as to whether the food is likely to be _low_, _medium_, _high_, or _very high_ in cholesterol. There is a much fuller explanation of how the data were collected and how the model was trained evaluated within the relevant Jupyter notebooks and series of posts on my [blog](https://www.medium.com/@andy.lane/).

2. A "real-world" dataset being used to explore and illustrate the utility of deep neural networks and word vector embeddings in extracting cholesterol predictions from the names of food items. This is under development, but the Jupyter notebooks are here in the root of this repo.
